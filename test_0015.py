 Problem 15 - Lattice paths

 Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move
 to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

    XXXXXXXXX    XXXXX---+    XXXXX---+
    |   |   X    |   X   |    |   X   |
    +---+---X    +---XXXXX    +---X---+
    |   |   X    |   |   X    |   X   |
    +---+---X    +---+---X    +---XXXXX

    X---+---+    X---+---+    X---+---+
    X   |   |    X   |   |    X   |   |
    XXXXXXXXX    XXXXX---+    X---+---+
    |   |   X    |   X   |    X   |   |
    +---+---X    +---XXXXX    XXXXXXXXX

 How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?
